# Movie-Recommendation-System
A very elementary work on movie recommendation system using user-user and item-item collaborative filtering with the help of cosine distances. Worked on the ml-100k dataset.
Further steps to be incorporatefd in the future are the inclusion of a metric system to track efficiency and the trial with Turicreate package and matrix factorization method.
